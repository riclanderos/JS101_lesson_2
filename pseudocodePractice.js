// => a function that returns the sum of two numbers
Given two numbers.
Add the first value to the second value.
Return the total value.

// => a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
Given an array of strings.
Utilize a method that will join the array strings and return a new string

// =>a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
// everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]
Given an array of integers.
Iterate through the collection.
Save the first value as the starting value.
For each iteration, check whether the values index is even or odd.
Reassign the saved value as the current value.
After iterating, return an array of every other value only.

// => a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

// => a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:
// merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
// You may assume that both array arguments have the same number of elements.
