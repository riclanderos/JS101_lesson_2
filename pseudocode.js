// Have user input his name
// Greet the user
// Ask user for first number
// Ask user for the second number
// Add first number to second number
// Return sum
// Display sum to the user

/* a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those
strings concatenated together */

/* a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every 
other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance: */
everyOther([1, 4, 7, 2, 5]); // => [1,7,5]

/* a function that determines the index of the 3rd ocurrence of a given character in a 
string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcxdxex' , 
the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not 
occur at least 3 times, return null. */

/* a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the 
arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes 
of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should becoome the 
elements at the odd indexes. For instance: */
merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
